function rmtf_callback(~,event)
%% Callback function for recording data in the background.

% The foreground -> the main program running in the MATLAB Command
% Window, while the background process runs asynchronously in parallel.

% This callback function should be used together with a listener. The
% listener should be configured before starting data acquisition.

% Use global variables to share data between the callback function and the
% main program.

% emg_asynch_chunk / emg_asynch_chunktime:
% Store one chunk of EMG data and its corresponding timestamps received
% from the listener during each callback.

% Each chunk currently contains 400 samples. This value can be changed in
% the listener configuration.

% emg_asynch_data / emg_asynch_time:
% Store the accumulated EMG data and timestamps. New data are appended
% each time the callback function is executed.

% If you want to access these variables inside a while or for loop, use
% 'drawnow' to allow MATLAB to process pending background callbacks and
% update the shared variables.
